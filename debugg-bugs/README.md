Add discord webhook url in server.lua, line 1 
Specify RedM or FiveM in html/scripts.js, line 2 (only affects discord webhook visuals)

This script allows players to report bugs through an in-game menu by typing /bugs in chat. This causes a window to popup where they can submit info that'll get sent to a discord server channel through a specified webhook url.
